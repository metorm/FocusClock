# FocusClock

A light-weight utility to stop you from f***ing around among irrelevant applications.

This app simply checks your foreground window to see if it belongs to a preconfigured list. If you are not working, it pops a large and blinking window on the right-down corner to remind you to go back to works.

# Download

Now we have is a very rudimentary release, but it is ready for practical use.

Just download and extract the files anywhere you like, configure `SampleConfig.json` (or use the default version to test it) and run `FocusClock.exe`.

# TODO

+ Add a clock in the pop-up windows
+ Write a configuration GUI, launch from the tray menu
+ Translate the UI

Any contribution is welcomed.
